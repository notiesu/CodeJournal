# About

Very simple tkinter Python app for competitive programming or interview prep questions. Features include adding/editing problems and contests, a timer, and some analytical insights.

Send me a pull request or issue if you want any new features.

# Getting Started

Just run these commands if it's your first time using this.
```
git clone https://github.com/notiesu/CodeJournal.git
cd CodeJournal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run this every time you want to start.
```
python myJournal.py
```

For your first entries, jsons are created (problems.json and contests.json) which allow you to store data easily.
Do not delete these unless you would like to lose your data.
